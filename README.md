#### Organization of this repository 

The development work can be found here: https://github.com/GNS-Science/nz-srm-slab/tree/main/model-development. The subfolders contain the analysis and are numbered according to the figures in the manuscript.

The original data used in the analyses can be found here: https://github.com/GNS-Science/nz-srm-slab/tree/main/model-development/data

Works using the catalogue can be found here: https://github.com/GNS-Science/nz-srm-slab/tree/main/model-development/catalog-work
The event-classsified and declustered catalogues are available here: https://github.com/GNS-Science/nz-srm-slab/tree/main/model-development/catalog-work/classified_catalogs
